     <h3>What to Know</h3>
     <br>
   <p class="Know">

     One of the most revered temple destinations of India, Kedarnath town is nestled in the mighty Garhwal Himalayas. The town, built around the revered Kedarnath temple, is located at an altitude of 3,580 m, near Chorabari glacier, which is the source of the Mandakini river. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the ancient temple has exquisite architecture and is built of extremely large but evenly shaped grey stone slabs. A conical rock formation inside the temple is worshipped as Lord Shiva in his “Sadashiva” form. <br><br> The Kedarnath temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a part of Char Dham pilgrimage circuit, and is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva in India. Behind the Kedarnath temple, stand the Kedarnath peak, Kedar Dome and other Himalayan peaks.
    <br><br>
  The historical name of this region is "Kedar Khand" and legend says, the Pandavas from the epic Mahabharata, after having defeated the Kauravas, felt guilty of having killed so many people and sought the blessings of Lord Shiva for redemption. The Lord eluded them repeatedly and took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull. The Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the surface at Kedarnath. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva appeared at four other places and are worshipped there
  as his manifestations.<br><br> The arms of the Lord appeared at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the belly at Madmaheshwar and his locks (hair) at Kalpeshwar. The Kedarnath and four above mentioned shrines make the revered Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit.

The Kedarnath trek located within the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, a 16-km route from Gaurikund to Kedarnath temple, is the most popular here. The trail meanders through forest-covered mountains, glaciers and is criss-crossed by numerous waterfalls. It is a medium to steep trek. There are fixed timings for the trek; 4 am to 1.30 pm, to coincide with the time slots of the sanctuary. The 800-m uphill trek from Kedarnath to Bhairavnath Temple or Bhairon Baba Mandir also falls on this route and offers magnificent views of the Kedarnath Temple and the verdant Kedarnath Valley. From Kedarnath, one can also trek to Chandrashila, a summit located 32 km away.

       Camping is an outdoor activity that involves staying the night/more than one night in a protective shelter out in nature. Camping is a broad term but in its essence, camping is a way of getting away from the hassle of urban life, to a more natural environment for a limited time. Recreational camping started in the late 19th century and became one of the most common outdoor activities all around the world.

The Kedarnath peak and Kedarnath Dome both offer great rock climbing opportunities with rocks, ice walls, crevasses, etc, attracting professional climbers. Both peaks have relatively easy routes on their northwest sides.
  Rock climbing is the sport or activity of climbing rock faces, especially with the aid of ropes and special equipment. The concept is to reach an endpoint, or a summit, of a rock face or structure. This can be done with specific equipment, depending on the difficulty and severity of the climb.
  It is a physically demanding sport that combines fitness and agility with the mental fortitude required to conquer an ascension or traverse. It can be perilous, but that is often considered a positive aspect of the adventure.
